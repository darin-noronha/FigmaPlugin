# Figma AI Layout Plugin

A Figma plugin that uses a trained machine learning model to automatically arrange UI components within frames, maintaining original sizes, preventing overlaps, and adding dynamic spacing for clean, organized layouts.

## Features

- **AI-driven positioning:** Automatically places objects based on model predictions.
- **Original sizes preserved:** Shapes keep their dimensions; no resizing applied.
- **Overlap prevention:** Grid-based placement ensures elements donâ€™t overlap.
- **Dynamic margins:** Adds proportional spacing for visually clean layouts.
- **Frame bounds respected:** Objects always stay within parent frames.
